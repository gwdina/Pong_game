# Pong_game
In simple terms it is pong. It plays a start sound when played, you can move the paddle up or down to bounce the ball back to the wall, 
the program will tell you if you hit the ball, and the game will end once the ball gets behind the player. This was made as the games I have on my laptop are 
"loud" due to the content clicking and fast hitting keyboard inputs, so I wanted a game that was quite in its input so I looked back at old retro games. And 
pong was a pefect, as it only required two inputs which didn't really needed to be fastly inputed (unless you set the ball speed to high). This helps with 
solving boardem with out annoying anyone in your enviroment.
